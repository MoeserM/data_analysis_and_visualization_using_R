## Get the data

We are using the gapminder dataset (<https://www.gapminder.org/data>) that has been put into an R package by @bryan2017 so we can load it with `library(gapminder)`.


```{r, message=F, include = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(gapminder)

```

Let's create a new shorter tibble called `gapdata2007` that only includes data for the year 2007.

```{r, results = "hide"}
gapdata2007 <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2007)
```

loads the gapminder dataset from the package environment into your Global Environment

```{r}
gapdata <- gapminder
```

Both `gapdata` and `gapdata2007` now show up in the Environment tab and can be clicked on/quickly viewed as usual.

## Homework week 5

Create the following figure of life expectancy in American countries (year 2007):
(if the figure seems too small in RStudio, open the 'fig_week5_homework.png' file in your homework folder)

![fig](fig_week5_homework.png)

Hints:

* If `geom_bar()` doesn't work try `geom_col()` or vice versa.
* `coord_flip()` to make the bars horizontal (it flips the `x` and `y` axes).
* `x = country` gets the country bars plotted in alphabetical order, use `x = fct_reorder(country, lifeExp)` still inside the `aes()` to order the bars by their `lifeExp` values. Or try one of the other variables (`pop`, `gdpPercap`) as the second argument to `fct_reorder()`.
* when using `fill = NA`, you also need to include a color; we're using `color = "deepskyblue"` inside the `geom_col()`.
* use `geom_text()` to label the `lifeExp`. You can use `round()` to round up to 1 digit. 
* Choose `theme_classic()`

```{r}

gapdata2007 %>% 
  filter(continent == 'Americas') %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(country, lifeExp), y = lifeExp)) + 
  geom_col(fill = NA, color = 'deepskyblue') + 
  coord_flip() + 
  geom_text(aes(label = round(lifeExp, 1))) + 
  theme_classic()

```

# Fine tuning plots

We can save a `ggplot()` object into a variable (we usually call it `p` but it can be any name). 
This then appears in the Environment tab. 
To plot it it needs to be recalled on a separate line to get drawn. 
Saving a plot into a variable allows us to modify it later (e.g., `p + theme_bw()`).


```{r,fig.height=3, fig.width=4, message=FALSE, fig.cap = "p0: Starting plot for the examples in this chapter."}

p0 <-  gapdata2007 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = lifeExp, x = gdpPercap, color = continent)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  theme_bw() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1")

p0
```

## Scales

### Logarithmic

Transforming an axis to a logarithmic scale can be done by adding on `scale_x_log10()`:

```{r}
p1 <- p0 + scale_x_log10()
p1
```

`scale_x_log10()` and `scale_y_log10()` are shortcuts for the base-10 logarithmic transformation of an axis.
The same could be achieved by using, e.g.,  `scale_x_continuous(trans = "log10")`. 
The latter can take a selection of options, namely `"reverse"`, `"log2"`, or `"sqrt"`.
Check the Help tab for `scale_continuous()` or look up its online documentation for a full list.

### Expand limits

A quick way to expand the limits of your plot is to specify the value you want to be included:

```{r}
p2 <- p0 + expand_limits(y = 0)
p2
```

Or two values for extending to both sides of the plot:

```{r}
p3 <- p0 + expand_limits(y = c(0, 100))
p3
```

By default, `ggplot()` adds some padding around the included area (see how the scale doesn't start from 0, but slightly before). 
This ensures points on the edges don't get overlapped with the axes, but in some cases - especially if you've already expanded the scale, you might want to remove this extra padding. 
You can remove this padding with the `expand` argument:

```{r}
p4 <- p0 +
  expand_limits(y = c(0, 100)) +
  coord_cartesian(expand = FALSE)

p4 
```



We are now using a new library - __patchwork__ - to print all 4 plots together.
Its syntax is very simple - it allows us to add ggplot objects together.
(Trying to do `p1 + p2` without loading the __patchwork__ package will not work, R will say "Error: Don't know how to add p2 to a plot".)


```{r, fig.cap = "p1: Using a logarithmic scale for the x axis. p2: Expanding the limits of the y axis to include 0. p3: Expanding the limits of the y axis to include 0 and 100. p4: Removing extra padding around the limits."}
library(patchwork)
p1 + p2 + p3 + p4 + plot_annotation(tag_levels = "1", tag_prefix = "p")
```


### Zoom in

```{r}
p5 <- p0 +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(70, 85), xlim = c(20000, 40000)) 

p5
```


How is this one different to the previous?


```{r}
p6 <- p0 +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(70, 85)) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(20000, 40000))
  #ylim(70, 85) + xlim(20000,40000)

p6
```

```{r, fig.height=3, fig.cap="p5: Using `coord_cartesian()` vs p6: Using `scale_x_continuous()` and `scale_y_continuous()` for setting the limits of plot axes."}
p5 + labs(tag = "p5") + p6 + labs(tag = "p6")

```


Previously we used **patchwork**'s `plot_annotation()` function to create our multiplot tags.
Since our exmaples no longer start the count from 1, we're using `ggplot()`'s tags instead, e.g., `labs(tag = "p5")`.
The `labs()` function will be covered in more detail later in this chapter.

### Axis ticks

`ggplot()` does a good job deciding how many and which values include on the axis.

But sometimes you'll want to specify these. We can do so by using the `breaks` argument:

```{r, fig.height=3, fig.cap = "p7: Specifiying y axis breaks. p8: Adding custom labels for our breaks."}
# calculating the maximum value to be included in the axis breaks:
max_value <- gapdata2007$lifeExp %>% max() %>% round(1)

# using scale_y_continuous(breaks = ...):
p7 <-  p0 +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 100), expand = FALSE) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(18, 50, max_value))

# we may also include custom labels for our breaks:
p8 <-  p0 +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 100), expand = FALSE) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(18, 50, max_value), labels = c("Adults", "50", "MAX"))

p7 + labs(tag = "p7") + p8 + labs(tag = "p8")
```

## Colors

### Using the Brewer palettes:

The easiest way to change the color palette of your `ggplot()` is to specify a Brewer palette.

```{r fig.height=3, fig.width=4}
p9 <- p0 +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Paired")
p9
```

Note that http://colorbrewer2.org/ also has options for *Colorblind safe* and *Print friendly*.


Another easy way for scientific publications is to use package **ggsci**. 

```{r, fig.height=3, fig.width=4}
library(ggsci)

p9 <- p0 +
  scale_color_rickandmorty()
p9
```


### Legend title

`scale_color_brewer()` or `scale_color_jama()` is also a convenient place to change the legend title.


```{r, fig.height=3, fig.width=4}
library(ggsci)

p10 <- p0 +
  scale_color_rickandmorty(name = "Continent - \n one of 5")
p10
```


Note the `\n` inside the new legend title - new line.

```{r, fig.height=3, fig.cap = "p9: Choosing a ggsci palette for your colors. p10: Changing the legend title."}
p9 + labs(tag = "p9") + p10 + labs(tag = "p10")
```


### Choosing colors manually

R also knows the names of many colors, so we can use words to specify colors:

```{r}
p11 <- p0 +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("red", "green", "blue", "purple", "pink"))
p11
```

The same function can also be used to use HEX codes for specifying colors:


```{r}
p12 <- p0 +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#8dd3c7", "#ffffb3", "#bebada",
                                "#fb8072", "#80b1d3"))
p12
```

```{r, fig.height=3, fig.cap = "Colors can also be specified using words (`\"red\"`, `\"green\"`, etc.), or HEX codes (`\"#8dd3c7\"`, `\"#ffffb3\"`, etc.)."}
p11 + labs(tag = "p11") + p12 + labs(tag = "p12")
```

## Titles and labels


We've been using the `labs(tag = )` function to add tags to plots.
But the `labs()` function can also be used to modify axis labels, or to add a title, subtitle, or a caption to your plot.

```{r, fig.height=3, fig.width=4, fig.cap = "p13: Adding on a title, subtitle, caption using `labs()`."}
p13 <- p0 +
  labs(x = "Gross domestic product per capita",
       y = "Life expectancy",
       title = "Health and economics",
       subtitle = "Gapminder dataset, 2007",
       caption = Sys.Date() %>% format("%B %d, %Y"),
       tag = "p13")

p13
```

### Annotation

In the previous chapter, we showed how use `geom_text()` and `geom_label()` to add text elements to a plot. 
Using geoms make sense when the values are based on data and variables mapped in `aes()`.
They are efficient for including multiple pieces of text or labels on your data.
For 'hand' annotating a plot, the `annotate()` function makes more sense, as you can quickly insert the type, location and label of your annotation.

```{r}
p14 <- p0 +
  annotate("text",
           x = 25000,
           y = 50,
           label = "No points here!")

```

```{r}
p15 <- p0 +
  annotate("label",
           x = 25000,
           y = 50,
           label = "No points here!")
```

```{r}
p16 <- p0 +
  annotate("label",
           x = 25000, 
           y = 50,
           label = "No points here!", 
           hjust = 0)
```

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.cap = "p14: `annotate(\"text\", ...)` to quickly add a text on your plot. p15: `annotate(\"label\")` is similar but draws a box around your text (making it a label). p16: Using `hjust` to control the horizontal justification of the annotation."}
p14 + labs(tag = "p14") + (p15 + labs(tag = "p15"))/ (p16 + labs(tag = "p16"))
```


`hjust` stands for horizontal justification. Its default value is 0.5 (see how the label was centered at 25,000 - our chosen x location), 0 means the label goes to the right from 25,000, 1 would make it end at 25,000.

### Annotation with a superscript and a variable

This is an advanced example on how to annotate your plot with something that has a superscipt and is based on a single value read in from a variable.


```{r, fig.height=3, fig.width=4, fig.cap = "p17: Using a superscript in your plot annotation."}
# a value we made up for this example
# a real analysis would get it from the linear model object
fit_glance <- tibble(r.squared = 0.7693465)


plot_rsquared <- paste0(
  "R^2 == ",
  fit_glance$r.squared %>% round(2))


p17 <- p0 +
  annotate("text",
           x = 25000, 
           y = 50,
           label = plot_rsquared, parse = TRUE,
           hjust = 0)

p17 + labs(tag = "p17")
```


## Overall look 

And finally, everything else on a plot - from font to background to the space between facets, can be changed using the `theme()` function.
As you saw in the previous chapter, in addition to its default grey background, `ggplot2` also comes with a few built-in themes, namely, `theme_bw()` or `theme_classic()`.
These produce good looking plots that may already be publication ready. 
But if we do decide to tweak them, then the main `theme()` arguments we use are `axis.text`, `axis.title`, and `legend.position`. 

Note that all of these go inside the `theme()`, and that the `axis.text` and `axis.title` arguments are usually followed by `= element_text()` as shown in the examples below.

### Text size

The way the `axis.text` and `axis.title` arguments of `theme()` work is that if you specify `.x` or `.y` it gets applied on that axis alone.
But not specifying these, applies the change on both.
Both the `angle` and `vjust` (vertical justification) options can be useful if your axis text doesn't fit well and overlaps.
It doesn't usually make sense to change the color of the font to anything other than `"black"`, we are using green and red here to indicate which parts of the plot get changed with each line.


```{r, fig.height=3, fig.width=4, fig.cap = "p18: Using `axis.text` and `axis.title` within `theme()` to tweak the appearance of your plot, including font size and angle. Colored font is used to indicate which part of the code was used to change each element."}
p18 <-  p0 +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(color = "green", size = 14),
        axis.text.x = element_text(color = "red",  angle = 45, vjust = 0.5, face = 'bold'),
        axis.title  = element_text(color = "blue", size = 16, family = "Times", face = 'italic')
        )

p18 + labs(tag = "p18")

```


### Legend position


The position of the legend can be changed using the `legend.position` argument within `theme()`. It can be positioned using the following words: `"right", "left", "top", "bottom"`.
Or to remove the legend completely, use `"none"`:


```{r}
p19 <- p0 +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
p19
```


Alternatively, we can use relative coordinates (0--1) to give the legend a relative x-y location.

```{r}
p20 <- p0 +
  theme(legend.position      = c(1,0), #bottom-right corner
        legend.justification = c(1,0)) 
p20
```


```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=8, fig.cap = "p19: Setting `theme(legend.position = \"none\")` removes it. p20: Relative coordinates such as `theme(legend.position = c(1,0)` can by used to place the legend within the plot area."}
p19 + labs(tag = "p19") + p20 + labs(tag = "p20")
```


Further `theme(legend.)` options can be used to change the size, background, spacing, etc., of the legend. 
However, for modifying the content of the legend, you'll have to use the `guides()` function. 
Again, `ggplot()`'s defaults are very good, and we rarely need to go into this much tweaking using both the `theme()` and `guides()` functions. But it is good to know what is possible.

For example, this is how to change the number of columns within the legend (Figure \@ref(fig:chap05-fig-p21)):


```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=4, fig.cap = "p21: Changing the number of columns within a legend."}
p21 <- p0 +
  guides(color = guide_legend(ncol = 2)) +
  theme(legend.position = "top") # moving to the top optional

p21 + labs(tag = "p21")
```


## Saving your plot

There are several ways to save your figures. 

- Save in Rstudio at each code chunk, right click the images. (**NOT RECOMMENDED**)
- Knit to an html, pdf or word document, and save the images from those files. 
- Or, use `ggsave()` function in your code. It can save a single plot into a variety of formats, namely `"pdf"` or `"png"`

```{r}
ggsave(p0, file = "my_saved_plot.pdf", width = 5, height = 4)
```


If you omit the first argument - the plot object - and call, e.g., `ggsave(file = "plot.png)` it will just save the last plot that got printed.

Text size tip: playing around with the width and height options (they're in inches) can be a convenient way to increase or decrease the relative size of the text on the plot.
Look at the relative font sizes of the two versions of the `ggsave()` call, one 5x4, the other one 10x8. 

```{r}
ggsave(p0, file = "my_saved_plot_larger.pdf", width = 10, height = 8)
```


Again, we emphasis the importance of understanding the underlying data through visualization, rather than relying on statistical tests or, heaven forbid, the p-value alone.
