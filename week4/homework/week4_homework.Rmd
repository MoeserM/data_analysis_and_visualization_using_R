```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

In the class we have the generated a line chart for `lifeExp ~ year` using the following code. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(gapminder)

gapdata %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, group = country)) +
  geom_line()
```

Modify the code to change the figure into this one. Use `theme_bw()`
