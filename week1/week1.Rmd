## What is R?

- R is a programming language for statistical computing and graphics.
- An open-source implementation of the S programming language
- Supported by a large community which provides packages for almost any kinds of applications.


## What is special about R?

- R is versatile and powerful - use it for
  - graphics;
  - all the statistical tests you can dream of;
  - machine learning and deep learning;
  - automated reports;
  - websites (personally don't recommend);
  - even books.
- R scripts can be reused - gives you efficiency and reproducibility.
- It is free to use by anyone, anywhere.


## What are the limiations of R?

- Full programming languages, harder to learn
- Not the best choice as the first computer language to learn
- Heavily rely on packages, learning curve
- Memory and speed

## What are the alternatives for R?

- Python (machine learning)

- Julia (attempt to be the successor to R)

- Go (big data)

## Install R

Download R from the official website. https://www.r-project.org/

Choose your OS (and architecture)

## Install RStudio

- Free software to make R easier
- Integrated development environment (IDE)
- Install at https://www.rstudio.com/

## Install libraries/packages

Scripting in R heavily relys on libraries/packages

#### How to install?

1. Use `install.packages()` command in the console. Make sure the package name is in the '', or "". 
2. Or go to "Tools->Install Packages..." in RStudio.

#### How to call the packages in your script?

Use `library()` in your script. Make sure you load the library before you use any functions from the package.

```{r, load tidyverse}

library(tidyverse)

```


## Install Github desktop

- Github desktop is the most user friendly way to use `Git` for version control

- Install at https://desktop.github.com/

- All the documentations, scripts and data can be accessed from my Github page. 

- Set up your github, and fork the workshop from Github. https://github.com/ViralSeq/data_analysis_and_visualization_using_R

- Clone the repo to your local computer. 

## Homework 

- Download R, RStudio, Github Desktop
- Fork workshop materials at https://github.com/ViralSeq/data_analysis_and_visualization_using_R
- Install package `tidyverse`.
- Knit the "/week1/homework/week1_homework.Rmd" file to a .html file.
