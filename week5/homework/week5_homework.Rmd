```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

First we load all the necessary datasets. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(gapminder)

gapdata <- gapminder

gapdata2007 <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2007)

```

Create the following figure of life expectancy in American countries (year 2007):
(if the figure seems too small in RStudio, open the 'fig_week5_homework.png' file in your homework folder)

![fig](fig_week5_homework.png)
Hints:

* If `geom_bar()` doesn't work try `geom_col()` or vice versa.
* `coord_flip()` to make the bars horizontal (it flips the `x` and `y` axes).
* `x = country` gets the country bars plotted in alphabetical order, use `x = fct_reorder(country, lifeExp)` still inside the `aes()` to order the bars by their `lifeExp` values. Or try one of the other variables (`pop`, `gdpPercap`) as the second argument to `fct_reorder()`.
* when using `fill = NA`, you also need to include a color; we're using `color = "deepskyblue"` inside the `geom_col()`.
* use `geom_text()` to label the `lifeExp`. You can use `round()` to round up to 1 digit. 
* Choose `theme_classic()`

```{r}

```
